Install Deap, Numpy, and Matplotlib before running. 

Run *main.py* to run the GP system, edit and run *display.py* with the right arguments to watch results, and edit and run *getplot.py* to get the plots of best and average values. 

Make sure you run *main.py* at least once before you run either of the other two.
